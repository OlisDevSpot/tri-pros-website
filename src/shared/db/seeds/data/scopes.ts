Mount and secure the outdoor condenser unit on a level concrete pad or wall bracket.  Ensure proper insulation and sealing of all penetrations to prevent air leaks.  Phase III: System Configuration & Testing Vacuum and charge the refrigerant system according to manufacturer specifications.  Connect the system to electrical power and test operation.  Configure remote controls and thermostat settings for optimal performance.  Provide homeowner training on proper use and maintenance.  Clean up all work areas and dispose of installation debris.  Agreement Notes:  Electrical trades, if required, will be billed separately.  Additional refrigerant line lengths beyond standard installation will incur extra charges.',
